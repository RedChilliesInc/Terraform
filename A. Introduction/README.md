# Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. Yes! that's you've heard right., Oh Let's read it one more time.

Sounds Intresting, we felt it as well for the first time., let\'s go further to understand further..,

With IaC, infrastructure specification is codified, which makes it easier to edit and distribute ensuring you to provision the same environment over and over. By codifying, IaC avoids undocumented, ad-hoc changes in short entire infra self-documented by code.,

So you might be wondering now what are advantages of using IaC, why should I use it first in place., just like Jeff.,

- Speed & Simple            : Run the code, Go grab a coffee and comeback to see your Infra resouces up and running like a magic.,
- Configuration Consistency : We sometimes misinterpret, get bored, make mistakes and tend to forget while IaC doesn't. Yeah just like Starbucks coffee, you find consistency across places. Guess the reason? because you just started operating code than resouces,
- Reusability               : DRY infering  Don't Repeat Yourself. IaC enables you create same infra over & over any number of times all just you have do it run it, yeah just run the code in the same way you did it first time.
