# Overview

"Hey Jeff, Why are looking worried" asked John walking towards.,\"I am panciked, If I will be able to complete my tasks before line, so much to do to setting up Dev & Application environments, so much changes last hour, so many surprises last minute" pale looking Jeff replied
"Oh, I wished I could help you but I wouldn't" said John, turning Jeff from anguish to anxiety
"What!!" Jeff uttered involuntarily
"Yeah, Thor like Terraform does real better job than me in rescuing you from this"
"John, Common make a cut, make it clear to me" yelled Jeff while John was about to start,
John picked up and started off saying, to you, yeah it to you, who is reading this.,

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) infers provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.Yes! that's you've heard right., Oh Let's read it one more time IaC is nothing more than the replacement of the traditional manual provisioning of infrastructure through administration consoles/GUIs by programming/development based approach (think scripting).

Sounds Intresting, we felt it., lets go furthe to understand further..,

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time. By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes in short entire infra self-documented by code.,

So you might be wondering now what are advantages of using IaC, why should I use it first in place., just like Jeff.,

- Speed & Simple            : Run the code, Go grab a coffee and comeback to see your Infra resouces up and running. IaC enables you provision resouces faster.
- Configuration Consistency : We sometimes misinterpret, get bored, make mistakes and tend to forget. IaC serves as source of truth for all infra tasks when used. Yeah just like Starbucks coffee, you find consistency across places when using IaC. Guess the reason? because you just started operating code than resouces,
- Reusability               : Surely you might have come across DRY principle sometime, expanding it infers Don't Repeat Yourself. Yes, using IaC enables you create same infra over & over in Dev, QA, UAT, Stage & Prod, and just that in different project, different team, literally anywhere all just you have do it run it, yeah just run the code in the same way you did it first time.
